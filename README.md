## This repository contains all the source code that was produced while doing the evaluation for my Master's thesis.

The aim of the thesis is to evaluate smart contract / dApp development environments/framework. 

Thus, the projects inside this repo aren't meant to be fully functioning and polished, but rather serve as a documentation of what was done during the evaluation.

Graphs contains scripts for creating graphs from the evaluation data and the rest of the folders show what was done while evaluating each development environments/frameworks.
